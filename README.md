# 📝 Rebate Debate 87A  

## 🤔 Really a Question of Fact?  
The denial of the 87A rebate for incomes up to ₹7,00,000 under the new tax regime has sparked considerable debate. While it may seem like a hardship for taxpayers, is it truly unfair? Explore whether the Income Tax Department took unilateral steps to curb this benefit for small taxpayers.  

## 📜 What Does the Proviso to Section 87A Say?  
The proviso to Section 87A specifies:  
> "Provided that where the total income of the assessee is chargeable to tax under sub-section (1A) of section 115BAC…”  

This indicates the rebate applies only to incomes taxed under Section 115BAC slab rates, excluding special or flat rates.  

## 🔄 A Comparison: Pre- and Post-115BAC Amendments to 87A  
Before 115BAC, the 87A rebate was simple:  
- Applicable to total incomes ≤ ₹5,00,000.  
- Deduction = 100% of tax or ₹12,500 (whichever is less).  

After 115BAC, it applies *only* to incomes taxed at slab rates under the section, excluding Long-Term Capital Gains (LTCG).  

## ⚖️ Conclusion: From Specific Exclusion to Exclusive Inclusion  
The debate revolves around a policy shift:  
- **Old 87A** relied on specific exclusions.  
- **Amended 87A** uses exclusive inclusion.  

📌 The Income Tax Department’s unexplained approval of the rebate for flat-rate incomes pre-July 5, 2024, contrasts with a Pune ruling allowing rebates against the amendment. Meanwhile, a PIL in Bombay High Court could redefine the rebate application.  

🚦 **We’ll have to wait and see** whether the department’s stance survives the judgment or if the law evolves post-verdict.
